# Challenge - Light Bulb Activity

In the terminal, make sure you're on the desktop and 
* use ```create-react-app``` plus your project name    
* cd into your project
* type ```atom .``` (or ```code .``` if you are using Visual Studio)
* take out any starter code you want to remove and proceed with the user stories below

### Light Bulb - User Stories
* As a user I can see a square on the screen with the word 'off' in the middle.

* As a user I can click anywhere on the square. When I click the square the words change from 'off' to 'on' and then back 'off' again.

### Stretch

* As a user, when I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. (still with the words on or off in the middle)
Super Stretch

* As a user, instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the off position and a white light bulb.

* As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns on and the light bulb changes from white to yellow.

### Epic Stretch

* As a user I see multiple different lightbulbs and switches that act independently of each other.

* As a user I can add or remove a light switch/bulb from the webpage.



# Getting Started

After you accept the assignment (or clone this repo), you'll want to install all the npm packages using Yarn:

```bash
$ cd ./light-bulb-activity
$ yarn install
```
If you get an error about Yarn not being found:

```bash
Command 'yarn' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install cmdtest
```
You can install it with:

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```
Then run ```yarn install``` one more time and then you are ready to start a server to run the application:

```bash
$ yarn start
```
Now you're ready to code!
